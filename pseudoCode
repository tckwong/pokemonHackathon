1. Each Pokemon could have a unique set of attacks - 4 separate buttons


function compTurn() {
    arrayofMoves[ice beam, leaf attack....]
    generate random number for array index
    generate random number for damage
    updateHealth()
}

Things to work on:
1. Update currentHP and display onto page
2. 1 button for User attack + add more to it later
3. Update cookie list
4. Fix functions to draw from cookies instead of variables
